1. Developed a real estate price prediction model for Bangalore: Created a machine learning model using Python and various libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas to predict real estate prices in Bangalore. This involved collecting and analyzing relevant data, performing preprocessing steps like removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables using pandas.
2. Achieved 85% accuracy score through GridSearchCV: Utilized GridSearchCV, a hyperparameter tuning technique, to optimize the model's performance. By exploring different combinations of hyperparameters and evaluating the model's accuracy using cross-validation, an impressive score of 85% was achieved, indicating the model's effectiveness in predicting real estate prices accurately.
3. Hosted the model using Streamlit: Created a user-friendly interface for the model by building a web application using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive data apps. This allowed users to input specific parameters, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and obtain predicted real estate prices for Bangalore.
